With the appbar, the view can be changed between customers, their training sessions and the calendar by clicking on the desired destination.

Customers can be added from the customer page on the top right hand corner by clicking on the plus icon, which opens up fillable fields. Training sessions can be added to a specific customer by clicking on the `add training` button from the customers row. This opens up a new modal window with fillable fields in it.

Customers and training sessions can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon on the left side of the row which is to be removed. Customers can be edited by clicking on the pen icon.

From the bottom right hand corner, users can navigate back and forth between pages. the amount of rows visible can also be set to 5, 10 or 20.

The calendar can be set to show training sessions in days, weeks or months. The agenda view shows all training sessions in a list.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
